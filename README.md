# Unveiling_Data_Insights_in_Pizza_Sales_through_PowerBI

Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to extract valuable insights for driving the business strategies.

🔑 Valuable Insights:

Weekly Highlights:

🎉 Based on our analysis, I found Fridays and Saturdays have the highest daily orders. So, I can recommend the company to offer the best schemes and deals to capture the weekend pizza forever!

Monthly Insights:

📆 🍕 The highest orders came in the months of July and January, while the lowest orders came in the months of February, September, and October, so I can recommend the company to run special promotions or events during these low-performing months to increase sales.

Pizza Category Secrets:

🍕🥇 Among all the pizza categories, Classic is the champion with a mouthwatering share of 26.91%. It's a clear favourite amongst our customers, so I can recommend them to explore new variations or promotions to maintain and boost its popularity.

Pizza Size Sensation:

🍕🍕🍕 For the pizza sales by size "Large" pizzas steal the spotlight, with a hefty 45.89% share, followed by "Medium" and "X-Large" pizzas with shares of 30.49% and 21.77% respectively.

I also found X-Large and XX-Large pizzas have low sales. So I can recommend them to creat enticing offers and schemes to increase their sales.
